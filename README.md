# Magic Sorter STL files
This repository holds all the STL files used by the sorter

# Material
All parts are printed in PLA except the following ones:

# Brim, raft, supports
None of the parts require supports, brim or raft. Depending on your 3D printer, however, you might want to add some brim to the smaller parts, to increase adhesion to the build plate.
