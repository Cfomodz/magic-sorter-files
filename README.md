# Material
All parts are printed in PLA except the following ones:  

## Heat resistant materials
For these parts you should use a more resistant material such as PETG or ASA, since they will be in close contact with the motors and their heat would deform the plastic part:

  - Z STRESS RELIEF.stl
  - ARM Z LARGE.stl
  
## Impact resistant parts
Camera parts should be printed using PETG, since over time they could sag.

# Brim, raft, supports
None of the parts require supports, brim or raft. Depending on your 3D printer, however, you might want to add some brim to the smaller parts, to increase adhesion to the build plate.
